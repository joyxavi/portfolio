  <p>
    The Online Voting System is a secure web-based application designed to conduct elections
    digitally in an efficient and transparent manner. The system eliminates the need for
    physical polling booths and enables voters to participate remotely while maintaining
    election integrity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Registered users can log in using secure credentials, cast their votes, and view election
    status. The system ensures that each user can vote only once, thereby preventing duplicate
    or fraudulent voting.
  </p>

  <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP for backend logic</li>
    <li>MySQL for database management</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>User registration and secure authentication</li>
    <li>Vote casting and vote tracking</li>
    <li>Admin panel for managing candidates and elections</li>
    <li>Automatic result generation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <p>
    Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in secure authentication mechanisms,
    session handling, relational database design, and implementing admin workflows.
    I also learned how to design systems that focus on security, reliability, and scalability.
